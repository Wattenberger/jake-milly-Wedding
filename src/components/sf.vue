          <h3>Lodging</h3>
          <p>While San Francisco has hundreds of hotels, most are not located near the wedding venue. We‚Äôve decided to forego the typical hotel room block scenario so you can find the lodging options that best suit your needs and budget. Note that while being near the venue will make your wedding commute more convenient, if you plan on doing a little San Francisco tourism while you‚Äôre here, we recommend staying downtown where you‚Äôll have better access to the sights and transit options. there are transit and taxi/uber options to easily get you to/from the venue.</p>
          <p>If you are looking for a hotel in the city, consider the <a href="http://www.hoteladagiosf.com/" target="_blank">Hotel Adagio</a>, <a href="http://www.chancellorhotel.com/" target="_blank">Chancellor</a>, <a href="http://www.baldwinhotel.com/http://www.chancellorhotel.com/" target="_blank">Baldwin</a>, or <a href="http://www.prescotthotel.com/" target="_blank">Prescott</a>. All four of these are within walking distance to major public transportation lines and well as downtown, Union Square, and Chinatown. Closest hotel in the vicinity of Stern Grove is <a href="http://www.daysinn.com/hotels/california/san-francisco/days-inn-san-francisco-at-the-beach/hotel-overview?cid=local" target="_blank">Days Inn San Francisco at the Beach</a>. If you are looking for a less traditional option, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/San-Francisco/homes?allow_override%5B%5D=&checkin=2017-08-25&checkout=2017-08-27&ib=true" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> is a great place to look.</p>
